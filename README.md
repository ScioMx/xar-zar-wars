<h1><strong>Xar-Zar-Wars</strong></h1>
<p>The kingdom of Xars is not so well planned. It has <strong>N</strong> troops spread around the kingdom. They are spread in such a way that it takes <strong>1 hour</strong> to transfer information from one troop to any other troop and also from the king's castle to the first troop</p>
<p>The Xars kingdom is now being threatened by the Zars kingdom. When the king of Xars finds out, he sends this information to one of the <strong>N</strong> troops and tells them to alert all other groups. A soldier from the troop that receives information is set to alert as many troops as possible. They maintain mutual communication and do not waste time in alerting the troops that have already received the information.</p>
<p>Once Zars kingdom enters territory of Xars, all the troops of Xars that received the information will be send to fight and will stop spreading the message. Xars and Zars are equally powerful so that even if one troop of Xars does not receive information and is not involved in the war, its army will lose.</p>
<p>So the question for you is, for Zars to win the war, within how many hours of the King of Xar finding out about the threat should they enter the territory of Xars kingdom?</p>
<p>Explanation with Sample <br /> <strong>Case 1:</strong> For only one troop, it takes 1 hour to transfer information from king's castle to the troop.<br /> <strong>Case 2:</strong> For two troops, it takes 1 hour to transfer information from king's castle to the troop. A soldier of this troop takes another hour to alert the other troop.<br /> <strong>Case 3:</strong> For three troops, it takes 1 hour for soldier <strong>X1</strong> to transfer information from king's castle to the troop. A soldier(<strong>X2</strong>) of this troop takes another hour to alert one other troop. In the mean while <strong>X1</strong> alerts the third troop.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong><br /> Create a program that reads a file called "input.txt" located in the same folder as the program with the following format:<br /> First line of input file has an integer <strong>T</strong>(number of test cases). <br /> <strong>T</strong> lines follows having an integer in each <strong>N </strong>(number of troops in Xars kingdom). <br /> <br /> As output the program should for each test case, print an integer answer within how many hours should Zars should enter Xars kingdom to win de war.</p>
